/**
 Collection items can be used to present item collections of
 a certain item type, e.g. in a collection view.
 
 For now `CollectionItemType` has many presentation-specific
 properties, which is legacy reasons, where collection items
 were always collection view cells. This will be solved in a
 future version.
 
 `IMPORTANT` Note that action sheets that contain items that
 are based on `CollectionItem` must do some tweaks to listen
 for tap events within its `ActionSheetCollectionItem`. This
 is because a `CollectionItem` has no reference to the sheet.
 This means that its selection action can't modify the sheet.
 This problem doesn't exist when you create an `ActionSheet`
 with an `ActionSheetCollectionItem` directly, without using
 a `Menu` with a `CollectionItem`, since the action sheet is
 aware of itself and can setup the collection item correctly.
